# 2024 Q3 AI in Architectural Design Elective (AR2AA010)

The aim of the course is to unlock and channel the creative potential of architects in the era of AI. 
This will be done mainly by providing valuable resources, and methods for quantitatively curating and evaluating visual architectural data.

The full name of the course is *AI in Architectural Design: Quantitative Analysis of Architectural Imagery*.
This course is given at the faculty of Architecture and the Built-Environment (Delft University of Technology) as a 5EC course in the third quarter of the first year of the Architecture Master's track: Master 2, Q3.
See: [study guide](https://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=63933) (not up-to-date yet), [flyer](https://brightspace.tudelft.nl/d2l/le/content/43165/viewContent/3551867/View).

The course consists of the following elements:

- *Lectures and tutorials*,
- *Paper seminars*,
- *Python assignments*,
- *Group project*.

Most information regarding the course can be found in this repository: see the [organization section](#organization). 
The high-level overview of the Python packages is provided and clarified in the [Python packages section](#python-packaging).
Tips and tricks about the usage and installation of Python libraries, scripts and notebooks can be found the [usage and installation section](#usage-and-installation).
Useful links to other repositories, archives, relevant projects, toolboxes, etc. can be found under [external links](#external-links).

## Organization

The repository has the following structure:

## Python packages

The Python tutorials are designed according to the following principles:

- *No-experience*. Students with no or limited background shoulde be able to relatively easily follow it,
- *Visually-engaged*. The toturials are highly visual to make it easier to grasp concepts and ideas, 
- *Context-driven*. The tutorials are designed around an architectural application / need / question - and *not* around a topic in programming,
- *Incremental complexity*. The tutorials are ordered from simple to more complex, and build on each other. Later tutorials often require the programming skills learned in earlier ones.

The tutorials are *application-driven* because the tutorials are meant for students in architectural design. 
Therefore, to maximally engage this audience group, a tutorial starts with an architectural application (or need, or question). 
The necessary programming concepts (and associated Pyhon libraries) that are needed to help 'solve' the application are woven into the tutorials, and are explained and used only when needed. 
Hence, instead of simply teaching a collection of programming concepts, the tutorials directly associate programming concepts to particular architectural applications. 

The tutorials are organized as follows:

- 1 - [Drawing with code](./1_code_canvas.ipynb)
- 2 - Representing the building
- 3 - [Representing the outside](./3_beyond_boundaries.ipynb)
- 4 - Architectural machine learning
- 5 - 3D to 2D
- 6 - Comparing buildings
