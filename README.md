# AI in Architectural Design

The aim of the course is to unlock and channel the creative potential of architects in the era of AI. 
This will be done mainly by providing valuable resources and methods for quantitatively curating and evaluating visual architectural data.
This course is delivered at the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment (Delft University of Technology) as a 5EC course in the third quarter of the first year of the Architecture Master's track: Master 2, Q3.
