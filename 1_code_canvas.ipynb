The **integration of text and code** allows for a fast understanding of programming, as it can be guided by text and visuals, and helps also in the development of your code, because of the chronological structure of the cells - the distinct code blocks - that you can run separately. **Create new notebook** by navigating to /File \"Create new notebook\"\n",
