        "\n",
        "- **Colab notebooks.**\n",
        "The main feature of Colab is the platform for writing and executing Python code. In fact, you are doing so right now. This *online notebook*, mainly inspired by the [Jupyter Notebook Environment](https://jupyter.org/), seamlessly integrates text (for explanation and structure) and code (for the application). The **integration of text and code** allows for a fast understanding of programming, as it can be guided by text and visuals, and helps also in the development of your code, because of the chronological structure of the cells - the distinct code blocks - that you can run separately. **Create new notebook** by navigating to /File \"Create new notebook\"\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Cells.**\n",
        "A notebook is a list of cells that either contain text (text cells; like this one) or executable code and its output (code cells; colored in gray). Text cells can contain images, Latex, HTML, etc. You can manually add code cells by clicking the **+CODE** and **+TEXT** buttons when you hover between cells.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Link to Google Drive.**\n",
        "A nice feature of Colab is that you can easily share your code, save it, and, most importantly, that Colab can be coupled to your Google Drive for storing and accessing the data in your own (or shared) folders.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **GPU access.**\n",
        "Your code runs on a different machine (computer), in a virtual environment that you can set yourself up (more about that later). These machines have access to great hardware accelerators, in the form of **graphical processing units (GPUs)**. GPUs can execute code, especially computations related to data science and machine learning, efficiently and much faster than on a central processing unit (CPU). (Why is beyond the scope here. Interested nonetheless? Check [this](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-a-cpu-and-a-gpu/).) For running and testing your code on large datasets and big machine learning models (which you will do in later assignments), GPUs are often crucial, because GPUs allow for fast training and code prototyping. The type of hardware accelerators can be changed under \"Runtime/Change runtime\" type in the navigation bar on the top.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Short keys for running code.**\n",
        "Code can be executed by your command. You can hit **\"Command/Ctrl+Enter\"** or **\"Shift+Enter\"** to run a code block - or simply press the run bottun in the code cell itself. Test for yourself the difference between \"Command/Ctrl\" and \"Shift\".\n",
