Python tutorials are designed according to the following principles:

- *No-experience*. Students with no or limited background shoulde be able to relatively easily follow it,
- *Visually-engaging*. The tutorials are highly visual to make it easier to grasp concepts and ideas, 
- *Context-driven*. The tutorials are designed around an architectural application / need / question - and *not* around a topic in programming,
- *Incremental complexity*. The tutorials are ordered from simple to more complex, and build on each other. Later tutorials often require the programming skills learned in earlier ones.

The tutorials are *application-driven* because the tutorials are meant for students in architectural design. 
Therefore, to maximally engage this audience group, a tutorial starts with an architectural application (or need, or question). 
The necessary programming concepts (and associated Pyhon libraries) that are needed to help 'solve' the application are woven into the tutorials, and are explained and used only when needed. 
Hence, instead of simply teaching a collection of programming concepts, the tutorials directly associate programming concepts to particular architectural applications. 

The tutorials are organized as follows:

- 1 - [Code canvas](./1_code_canvas.ipynb)
- 2 - Representing the building
- 3 - Floor plan representation
- 4 - Street view imagery
- 5 - [Beyond boundaries](./4_beyond_boundaries.ipynb)
- 6 - 
- 7 - T-SNE
